# Disability Analysis

# Principle 1: Leadership of Those Most Impacted

Definition: 
The principle of Leadership of Those Most Impacted states that accessibility solutions should be guided by people who directly experience disability-related barriers, rather than designed solely by non disabled people. Disabled individuals possess lived experience that is extremely valuable. They know about systemic accessibility failures, communication barriers, and accessible strategies that cannot be replicated.

Our project does not fully meet this principle, because our team members do not personally identify as disabled users of speech-to-text assistive technologies. As a result, there is risk that design decisions may unintentionally reflect assumptions about user needs rather than lived realities.

However, we attempt to mitigate this limitation through practices learned in class:
- incorporating first-person accounts from Deaf, hard-of-hearing, and neurodivergent users discussing note-taking barriers
- analyzing accessibility critiques of existing captioning and transcription systems,
- grounding feature decisions (editable transcripts, customizable summaries, multilingual support) in documented accessibility needs rather than convenience-driven design.

While these steps are some improvement, they of course do not replace direct leadership by disabled users. 

# Principle 2: Intersectionality

Intersectionality recognizes that disability is not the sole idenity of an individual, and they do not tell the whole story of a persons experience. Experiences of accessibility are shaped by overlapping identities such as language background, race, socioeconomic status, education, and additional disabilities. Technologies that assume a single “average” disabled user often exclude those with compounded barriers.

We want our technology to reflect intersectionality and prioritize it. The design intentionally accommodates diverse user contexts by:
- supporting multiple spoken languages,
- enabling interaction without reliance on fine motor control, providing visual, textual, and editable outputs,
- allowing customization of summaries to reduce cognitive load.

These choices acknowledge that users may simultaneously experience hearing loss, motor impairments, language barriers, or neurodivergence. Rather than targeting one disability category, we want to provide access for people from many different identities and environments. So, we hope that our technology does meet this principle.

Is the Technology Ableist?

We hope that our technology, as it is designed with accessibility as a priority, will not be ableist. However, while the app attempts to reduce ableism, it may still reproduce ableist assumptions common in speech technologies. This will be dependent on if our system is trained on good data, and can have a high success rate. Speech-to-text systems often perform worse for non-standard accents, speech impairments, or atypical communication styles, implicitly privileging normative speech patterns, and we need to make sure we do our best to mitigate this if it is technically feasible to do so.  

A good thing is by designing the features of transcript correction, personalization, and post-editing control, our system challenges the assumption that AI output is authoritative. Thus, allowing users to have more control over their tool. But, reliance on speech input means barriers may remain for users with limited or non-verbal speech, indicating partial, but not complete, avoidance of ableism.

Is It Informed by Disabled Perspectives?

The project is not led or designed by people with disabilities. However, it is informed by disabled perspectives through accessibility research, first-person narratives, and critiques of existing assistive technologies. Our design decisions prioritize documented frustrations from users with disabilities using these kinds of technologies in the past. These frustrations include caption inaccuracies, cognitive overload, and lack of editing agency.

However, without participatory design or co-creation with disabled stakeholders, one could argue it is not informed enough. 

Does It Oversimplify Disability or Identity?

We want to avoid oversimplification by recognizing the true range accessibility needs and offering customizable interaction modes. It does not assume a single disability type or uniform solution.

That said, any generalized assistive system risks oversimplification, just due to different existing models inadequacies. Improvements would require engagement with diverse disability communities to ensure accurate representations of real-world experiences.
